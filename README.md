# gdocs-twine
[Twine](https://twinery.org) is a tool for telling hypertext stories. It's got a cool interface that lets you do things like visualize your story's structure, but it doesn't allow for collaborative editing. Gdocs-twine fills that gap by allowing you to build a Twine story as a Google Doc. 

Here's [an example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qehNM140m47Mykxpcj9JO9tE_ghJDUacv4B6fhs_jmY/pub) of the source format, and [what it looks like rendered](https://danielsmc.github.io/gdocs-twine/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F1qehNM140m47Mykxpcj9JO9tE_ghJDUacv4B6fhs_jmY%2Fpub).

## TODO
* Import/Export Tools
* Better documentation
* Support for story scripts and styles
